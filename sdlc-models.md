# What are the different types of SDLC models
## 1. Waterfall Model
- Linear and sequential approach.
- Each phase must be completed before the next starts.

## 2. V-Model (Verification and Validation)
- Extension of Waterfall with testing for each development phase.
- Strong focus on quality assurance.

## 3. Iterative Model
- Development in small iterations.
- Each iteration adds improvements or features.

## 4. Spiral Model
- Combines Iterative and Waterfall with risk analysis.
- Suitable for large, high-risk projects.

## 5. Agile Model
- Flexible, iterative, and customer-focused.
- Work divided into sprints with continuous feedback.

## 6. Big Bang Model
- Minimal planning; coding starts immediately.
- Suitable for small projects with unclear requirements.

## 7. Incremental Model
- Product built in increments (modules).
- Each increment adds functionality.

## 8. RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model
- Emphasizes fast prototyping and user involvement.
- Uses reusable components for quick delivery.
